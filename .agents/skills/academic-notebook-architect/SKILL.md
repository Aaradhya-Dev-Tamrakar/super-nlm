description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "prepare semester notebooks", "scaffold subject notes folder", "organize academic course notes", "extract syllabus into NotebookLM", "batch create course notebooks", or mentions setting up curriculum folders for engineering/university semesters (such as IOE BEI/BCT semesters like IV-I, IV-II) with Super-NLM fleet provisioning and Fleet-Orchestrator task delegation.

# Academic Notebook Architect Skill

This skill provides an end-to-end procedural workflow for scaffolding academic semester note repositories, extracting modular per-subject syllabi, generating formula-dense high-yield study hubs with exam traps, provisioning Google NotebookLM notebooks across a multi-account fleet (Super-NLM), and delegating heavy extraction workloads to autonomous swarms (Fleet-Orchestrator).

## 1. Architectural Overview & Scaffolding Invariants

An effective academic knowledge repository must maintain clear separation between raw lecture materials, official syllabi, past examination papers, and synthesized study hubs.

```
<Semester Root>/ (e.g., [IV-II]/)
├── <Core Subject 1>/
│   ├── <Subject>_Syllabus.md          # Extracted syllabus units and references
│   ├── StudyHub.md                    # High-yield KaTeX formulas and exam traps
│   ├── Notes by <Faculty> Sir/        # Faculty-specific lecture slides and notes
│   ├── Slides/                        # Presentation decks
│   └── Chapterwise/                   # Granular chapter files
├── Past Qns/                          # Centralized past questions hub
│   ├── Past_Questions_Index.md        # Unified index across all courses
│   └── <Year>.<Part><program>_<subject>_<type>.pdf
├── Elective <Tier>/                   # Modular, zero-lock-in elective catalogs
│   ├── _Elective_<Tier>_Options_Catalog.md
│   ├── <Candidate Elective 1>/Syllabus.md
│   └── <Candidate Elective 2>/Syllabus.md (Preserves existing files if active)
└── Project (Part B)/
    └── Project_Guidelines.md
```

### The Invariants
1. **Never Overwrite or Flatten Existing Assets**: If a folder already contains instructor notes or slides (e.g. 130 files in a candidate elective), preserve every file intact. Place new `Syllabus.md` or `StudyHub.md` alongside existing resources.
2. **Undecided Electives Agnosticism**: When electives are not finalized, do **not** force a single selection. Proactively scaffold placeholder directories with extracted syllabi for **all curriculum elective options** (e.g. 8 for Elective II, 8 for Elective III) and create `_Elective_Options_Catalog.md`.
3. **Dual-Mirroring of Study Hubs**: Place synthesized study guides both in the local subject directory (`<Subject>/StudyHub.md`) and in the project `data/<subject>_guide.md` directory for CLI/MCP queries.
4. **Zero Repo Pollution for Artifacts**: Route all downloaded or generated video/audio/quiz files outside the repo to `C:\Users\Aaradhya\Downloads\<CourseCode> Exam`.

## 2. Four-Stage Operational Protocol

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Syllabus["Master Curriculum (PDF / MD)"] --> Stage1["Stage 1: Local Folder Scaffolding<br/>(scripts/scaffold_semester.py)"]
    Stage1 --> Stage2["Stage 2: High-Yield Study Hub Synthesis<br/>(KaTeX Math, Exam Traps, Formulas)"]
    Stage2 --> Stage3["Stage 3: Super-NLM Multi-Account Fleet Provisioning<br/>(scripts/batch_provision_fleet.py)"]
    Stage2 --> Stage4["Stage 4: Fleet-Orchestrator Swarm Delegation<br/>(sku-templates/course_study_pack.json)"]

    Stage3 --> NLM["Active Google NotebookLM Fleet"]
    Stage4 --> Swarm["Autonomous Task Queue & Checkpoints"]
```

### Stage 1: Local Filesystem Scaffolding
Run the bundled script to parse the master syllabus markdown and generate the folder tree:
```powershell
python <skill_path>/scripts/scaffold_semester.py --syllabus "<path_to_syllabus.md>" --target-dir "<semester_path>"
```
- Extracts individual markdown syllabus files for each core course.
- Creates `Past Qns/` and standardizes question bank file names (`<Year>.<Part><program>_<subject>_<type>.pdf`).
- Generates placeholder directories and `Syllabus.md` files for all candidate elective options.

### Stage 2: High-Yield Study Hub Synthesis
Author a `StudyHub.md` for each core subject modeled after `dsap_guide.md`:
1. **Mathematical Rigor**: All formulas must be formatted in strict KaTeX (`$...$` for inline, `$$...$$` for block math).
2. **Unit-by-Unit Mark Weightage**: Explicitly list hours and expected marks matching official exam blueprints.
3. **Golden Traps Section**: Highlight classic numerical pitfalls, edge cases, and legal clauses (e.g., Erlang B recursion, Clos non-blocking conditions, PV derating factors, NEC Act liabilities).
4. **Mirroring**: Copy the guide to both `super-nlm/data/<subject>_guide.md` and `<Subject>/StudyHub.md`.

### Stage 3: Super-NLM Multi-Account Fleet Provisioning
Provision and bind notebooks across connected Google accounts:
```powershell
python <skill_path>/scripts/batch_provision_fleet.py --owner-profile default --share-role editor
```
1. **Batch Creation**: Calls `nlm notebook create "<CourseCode> - <Title>" -p <profile> --json`.
2. **Folder Mapping**: Registers entries in `data/folder_mappings.json` (`folder_type: "local_folder"`, `auto_sync: true`, `recursive: true`).
3. **Exam Download Hubs**: Creates `C:\Users\Aaradhya\Downloads\<CourseCode> Exam` directories.
4. **Source Ingestion**: Ingests syllabus extracts and `StudyHub.md` via `nlm source add <id> --file <path> -p <profile> --wait`.
5. **Cross-Fleet Sharing**: Discovers all collaborator accounts from `data/profiles.json` and runs `nlm share batch <id> "<emails>" --role editor -p <profile>`.

### Stage 4: Fleet-Orchestrator Swarm Delegation
For heavy reading tasks (parsing dozens of slide decks and textbooks):
1. Use declarative SKU template `Fleet-Orchestrator/sku-templates/iv_ii_course_study_pack.json`.
2. Enqueue extraction tasks into `orchestrator-state/tasks/`.
3. Let the 27 pooled Copilot/Gemini workers process tasks in parallel and write checkpoints.
